Abstract = {{A total of 271 pollen records were selected from a large collection of
   both raw and digitized pollen spectra from eastern continental Asia (70
   degrees-135 degrees E and 18 degrees-55 degrees N). Following pollen
   percentage recalculations, taxonomic homogenization, and age-depth model
   revision, the pollen spectra were interpolated at a 500-year resolution
   and a taxonomically harmonized and temporally standardized fossil pollen
   dataset established with 226 pollen taxa, covering the last 22 cal lea.
   Of the 271 pollen records, 85\% were published since 1990, with reliable
   chronologies and high temporal resolutions; of these, 50\% have raw data
   with complete pollen assemblages, ensuring the quality of this dataset
   The pollen records available for each 500-year time slice are well
   distributed over all main vegetation types and climatic zones of the
   study area, making their pollen spectra suitable for paleovegetation and
   paleoclimate research. Such a dataset can be used as an example for the
   development of similar datasets for other regions of the world. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Based on modern pollen samples from different vegetation units in
   southern Patagonia, showing a close relation to yearly amounts of
   precipitation and mean annual temperatures, different pollen-climate
   transfer functions are developed and tested. Comparing the performance
   of MAT (Modern Analogue Techniques), WA (Weighted Average), as well as
   WAPLS (Weighted Average Partial Least Square) statistical techniques, it
   is possible to determine the statistically most robust model (WAPLS for
   precipitation). This transfer function is then used to estimate
   palaeoprecipitation amounts based on Laguna Potrok Aike pollen results
   for the last 16,000 years. Generally, the results of the precipitation
   model indicate less precipitation during the Lateglacial and alternating
   wet and dry periods during the Holocene. The Holocene started with
   higher amounts of precipitation until about 8 ka cal. BP, followed by a
   period with lower amounts between 8 and 2.5 ka cal. BP, while the Late
   Holocene shows a general increase in precipitation. Comparisons with
   former shoreline reconstructions and carbonate concentrations in the
   sediments of Laguna Potrok Aike not always show similarities due to the
   complex environmental factors recorded by these proxies. Moreover,
   changes in the moisture availability due to the interplay of
   precipitation and temperature, cannot be reconstructed directly.
   Nevertheless, the general long-term trend of palaeoprecipitation is in
   accordance with the absolute moisture content in the air, which is
   determined mainly by temperature: during cold periods with less absolute
   moisture, the model shows less precipitation. Moreover, the model also
   points to a relation with the position and strength of the Southern
   Hemisphere Westerlies. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A 9.35-m long sediment core, CK2, that covers the time span between
   31.98 and 9.14 kilo annum before present (ka BP) at the Luobei
   Depression (Lop Nur, Eastern Xinjiang, Northwest China) was studied by
   pollen analysis. The pollen assemblages of coniferous trees, temperate
   deciduous trees, herbs, and shrubs can be divided into the following
   four stages: Zone I (31.98 ka BP to 19.26 ka BP) corresponds to a steppe
   or desert steppe landscape, which conforms to the cold-wet climatic
   environment of the Last Glacial Maximum; Zone II (19.26 ka BP to 13.67
   ka BP) corresponds to a steppe desert or desert landscape, which
   conforms to the warm-arid climatic environment of the transient
   interglacial period; Zones III (13.67 ka BP to 12.73 ka BP) and IV
   (12.73 ka BP to 9.14 ka BP) are similar to Zones I and II, respectively,
   corresponding to the late last glacial and post last glacial, i.e.,
   Early Holocene, respectively. The climatic environment in Lop Nur was
   increasingly getting drier based on Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae ratios of
   <= 0.5 in Subzones IVa and IVc. The Heinrich cold events (H3, H2, H1,
   and YD) and the Dansgaard-Oeschger warm events (IS4, IS3, IS2, IS1) with
   millennial-scale changes appearing at high latitudes can also be found
   in the pollen records of Lop Nur. Results show that the climate
   characteristics of the Lop Nur region are mainly controlled by the
   westerly belt, as displayed in mainly cold-wet or warm-arid
   synchronization. These climate characteristics differ from those of the
   monsoon area, which are mainly displayed in cold-arid and warm-wet

Abstract = {{A 5.88-m-long core taken from Lake Ulaan was studied for high-resolution
   paleoclimatic changes during the last 17000 years. The core sediments
   are divided into three units based on grain-size distribution: unit 1
   (top to 392cm depth, covering the last 11200 years), unit 2 (392530cm,
   11.215 ka) and unit 3 (530588cm, 15.016.7 ka). These sediments were
   transported by local westerly winds (units 1 and 3) and fluvial
   processes (unit 2). Based on major element compositions and geological
   setting of adjacent areas, provenance of unit 1 sediments was
   interpreted to be the Lake terrane, and that of unit 2 to be the Idermeg
   terrane. Unit 3 sediments were derived from the Gobi Altai terrane. The
   records of total organic carbon, C/N ratio and weathering intensity
   suggest that paleoclimate in the source area of Lake Ulaan sediment was
   most humid during the Early Holocene, humid during the mid-Holocene and
   dry in the Late Holocene. The decrease of humidity through the Holocene
   is a typical characteristic of the East Asian monsoon region. Comparison
   with lacustrine records of other Mongolia regions suggests that the

   located further north than previously assumed. Copyright (c) 2013 John

Abstract = {{Precise and accurate reconstructions of past environmental parameters
   from high-quality palaeoenvironmental studies are critical for realistic
   testing of climate models. To ascertain the reliability of the
   reconstructions of the past, cross-validation from a variety of proxies
   and methods is essential. Mid-Scandinavia, showing a variety of
   palaeoecological studies, is a suitable region for comparing and
   validating environmental reconstructions. Here, pollen-based
   transfer-function reconstructions show inconsistent late-glacial
   temperature patterns. They also show that the Holocene Thermal Maximum
   (HTM) occurs at ca. 7.5-4.5 cal. ka b.p. However, thermal indicators
   (pollen, megafossils, plant macrofossils) place the HTM at no later than
   ca. 10-7.5 cal. ka b.p. It is argued that after the onset of the early
   Holocene warming equilibrium between vegetation and climate was
   established over a prolonged period; i.e. ca. 1,500 and 4,000 years in
   the mountains and lowlands, respectively. In the mountains, soil
   drought, wind and winter stress were important factors causing the lag,
   whereas inter-specific competition and soil development delayed the
   succession within the species-diverse lowland forests. These lags when
   vegetation was not filling its thermal potential result in a distortion
   of the temperature signal as derived by transfer functions which assume
   that vegetation is essentially in equilibrium with climate. Due to
   widespread human impact and erosion today, many modern training set
   samples are unsuitable as reference material for past environmental
   conditions. Various recommendations are suggested towards making
   improvements in the pollen-transfer function approach to climate
   reconstructions. To overcome the difficulties resulting from vegetation
   lags in the early Holocene, proxies that have a faster response time to
   climate, such as chironomids and aquatic plants including algae, may
   replace terrestrial pollen.}},

Abstract = {{Projecting the future composition and function of communities is a major
   challenge, and there is an urgent need to develop, improve, and test the
   predictive capacity of ecological models under different climate states.
   We tested the effect of climate on spatial patterns of plant community
   composition over the past 21 000 yr, focusing on whether the spatial
   relationships between environmental distance and compositional
   dissimilarity are stable over time. We used a network of fossil-pollen
   sites in eastern North America, combined with paleoclimate simulations
   from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 000 calibrated years before
   present, 21 kyr BP) to the present. We modeled relationships between
   climate, geography, and compositional dissimilarity at 1 kyr periods
   using generalized dissimilarity modeling (GDM) and determined the
   strongest predictors of compositional dissimilarity. We assessed the
   performance of models calibrated for one time period (e.g. 14 kyr BP) in
   predicting patterns in the same period as well as at other times (e.g.
   12 kyr BP), and tested whether predictive performance was related to the
   magnitude of climate change between the calibration and prediction time
   periods. Finally, we examined whether pooling data from multiple time
   periods improved predictive performance. Models explained 32 to 51\% of
   compositional dissimilarity between locations within any single time
   period. The best set of predictors changed across time, with summer
   temperature and geographic distance the strongest predictors of
   compositional dissimilarity for most time periods. Models built for one
   time period explained turnover during nearby time periods relatively
   well, but performance decayed across time and with increasing climate
   change. Results were similar regardless of whether models were projected
   forward or backward through time, and did not improve when data were
   pooled across time. GDM predicts well the spatial patterns of past
   compositional dissimilarity and holds promise for modeling the drivers
   of compositional dissimilarity across space and time. However, the
   modeled relationships between compositional turnover and environmental
   distance are non-stationary, so caution is needed when predicting across
   periods of significant climatic change.}},

Abstract = {{The sedimentary record of the volcanic lake known as the Fuentillejo
   maar (central Spain) offers the opportunity to determine the
   palaeoenvironmental evolution of the central-southern part of the
   Iberian Peninsula during the Middle and Upper Pleistocene. A total of
   439 samples from the upper 88 m of a ca. 142 m long core (spanning the
   last ca. 355 ka) were examined. The interval corresponds to the last 220
   ka of the record. High n-alkane CPI values and the presence of sulfur
   revealed that little diagenetic signal attenuation or modification had
   occurred. A number of n-alkane-based indices (e.g. predominant n-alkane,
   ACL, Paq and TAR(HC) ratios, and the proportion of C-27, C-29 and C-31
   n-alkanes with respect to the summed C-27 + C-29 + C-31) alkanes, showed
   changing conditions in the organic matter input to the maar lake over
   time, with episodes involving a major input of terrestrial vegetation,
   alternating with others in which algae or a mixed input of terrestrial
   plants, aquatic macrophytes and algae occurred. The proportions of C-27,
   C-29 and C-31 were useful for reconstructing the palaeoenvironmental
   evolution of the basin as they allowed assignment of several dry
   intervals during which grasses developed, while during humid phases
   trees expanded at the expense of grasses.
   In general, we found good correspondence between these episodes and the
   climatic cycles observed in delta O-18 records from ices cores in
   Greenland and Antarctica, as well as from marine cores. Thus, we
   conclude that global palaeoclimatological changes were recorded in the
   maar record. Likewise, Heinrich Events appeared to be reflected in the
   n-alkane indices. This was confirmed by single spectral analysis and
   cross spectral analysis with the insolation curve on 21 July at a
   latitude of 65 degrees N. The approach revealed that the cycles
   interpreted in the Fuentillejo record (103, 41, 23 and 19 ka) showed
   evidence of orbital influence related to the astronomical cycles of the
   eccentricity variation in the Earth's orbit, the Earth's obliquity
   oscillation, and the precession variation (Milankovitch theory). (C)

Abstract = {{Climate models suggest that Asian paleoenvironments, monsoons and
   continental aridification were primarily governed by tectonic uplift and
   sea retreat since the Eocene with potential contribution of global
   climate changes: However, the cause and timing of these
   paleoenvironmental changes remain poorly constrained. The recently
   well-dated continental mudflat to ephemeral saline lake sedimentary
   succession, situated in the Xining Basin at the northeastern margin of
   the Tibetan Plateau (NW China), provides a unique opportunity to develop
   additional proxy successions in this area that are placed accurately in
   time. Here, a palynological record from this succession is reported.
   High abundances of desert and steppe-desert taxa such as Ephedripites
   and Nitrariadites/Nitraripollis are found, which can be differentiated
   by the presence of broad leaved deciduous forest taxa in the lower part
   of the section (particularly up to 36.4 Ma; magnetochron C16r), and a
   sudden increase of Pinaceae (Pinuspollenites, Piceaepollenites and
   Abiespollenites) which is dated at 36.1 Ma (C16n.2n). Coexistence
   Approach (CoA) indicates that from 39.9 to 36.4 Ma (C17n.1n) regional
   climate was warm and wet, while from 36.4 to 33.5 Ma (C16n.2n-C13r)
   climate tends to be cooler and drier. The data indicate that
   paleoenvironmental and palynological changes on the NE part of the
   Tibetan Plateau resulted from a combination of long-term tectonic uplift
   forcing and long- and short-term climate changes. The increase of taxa
   such as Piceaepollenites and Abiespollenites indicates not only a
   cooling and drying trend prior to the Eocene/Oligocene (E/O) boundary,
   but also the existence of high altitude mountain habitats in the
   periphery of the Xining Basin. The sudden Pinaceae event correlates
   closely in time with a marked aridification step as viewed from the
   lithology of the Xining Basin that was linked to the sea retreat out of

   challenging to identify regional patterns associated with short term

Abstract = {{This study presents a newly compiled dataset of modern pollen and
   climate data from 798 sites across Japan and the Russian Far East. This
   comprehensive reference dataset combined with the modern analogue
   technique (MAT) provides a powerful tool for pollen-based reconstruction
   of the Quaternary Northwest Pacific climate. Pollen-derived
   reconstruction of the modern climate at the reference pollen-sampling
   sites matches well with the estimated modern climate values (R-2 values
   vary between 0.79 and 0.95, and RMSEP values vary between 5.8 and 9.7\%
   of the modern climatic range for all nine tested variables). The
   successful testing of the method encourages its application to the
   fossil pollen records. We used a coarse-resolution pollen record from
   Lake Biwa to reconstruct glacial-interglacial climate dynamics in
   central Japan since similar to 438 kyr and compared it to the earlier
   reconstruction based on a less representative reference dataset. The
   current and earlier results consistently demonstrate that the coldest
   glacial intervals experienced pronounced cooling in winter and moderate
   cooling in summer, supporting the growth of cool mixed forest (COMX)
   where warm mixed forest (WAMX) predominates today. During the last
   glacial, maximum (similar to 24 kyr BP) mean temperatures of the coldest
   (MTCO) and warmest (MTWA) month were about -13 degrees C (RMSEP = 2.34
   degrees C) and 21 degrees C (RMSEP = 1.66 degrees C) respectively, and
   annual precipitation (PANN) was about 800 mm (RMSEP = 158.06 mm). During
   the thermal optimums of the interglacial intervals, the temperatures of
   the coldest and warmest month were above 0 degrees C and 25 degrees C
   respectively, leading to the reconstruction of WAMX and temperate
   conifer forest (TECO). Although both these vegetation types grow in the
   southern part of Japan today, WAMX requires warmer space. The presence
   of WAMX during marine isotope stages (MIS) 11 and 1, and its absence
   during MIS 9 and MIS 5 contradict the marine isotope and Antarctic ice
   records, suggesting that the latter two interglacials were the warmest
   of the last 800 kyr. The apparent contradiction allows at least three
   different explanations including low temporal resolution of the pollen
   record; different trends in CO2 concentrations during `short' and `long'
   interglacials; and regional climate variability and non-linear response
   of different regions to the global forcing. More definitive conclusions
   will be possible on the basis of forthcoming high-resolution pollen
   records from central Japan. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Core DGKS9602 (931 cm in length) was retrieved from the Middle Okinawa
   Trough. The age model was correlated with the adjacent core, DGKS9603
   (Li et al., 2001), for the upper part and to the standard SPECMAP
   chronology down to similar to 60 ka BP using marine oxygen isotope
   control points. Pollen analysis was carried out, and seven pollen zones
   were identified. The results showed that the pollen spectra in MIS 3
   were very different to MIS 2 but comparable with the Holocene. The
   saccate pollen, principally Pinus, predominated in most parts of the
   core, except for the interval of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the
   late MIS 3 when Artemisia and other herbs increased prominently. The
   ratios of P/A (Pinus/Artemisia) and of PB/NAP (pollen with bladders
   versus non-arboreal pollen) were used as a proxy for sea-level change
   and for estimating distances from the coastline to the study site. The
   provenance study, using a modern analog technique based on the East
   Asian Modern Pollen Database and fossil pollen assemblages, revealed
   that the pollen were derived from diverse source areas during different
   stages since similar to 60 ka BP. The pollen zones equivalent to MIS 1
   and 3 were characterized by uncertain and disparate areas of provenance,
   and the surrounding continents, including Eastern Mainland China, Korea
   and Southern Japan, possibly made equivalent contributions, which may be
   the result of enhanced pollen transport by the northwesterly wind.
   However, the LGM represented in core DGKS9602 was distinguished by
   restricted sources from the exposed East China shelf, where the
   vegetation was quite similar with the herb coverage in the present-day
   North China Plain. The pollen assemblages sensitively reflected the
   coastline changes, marked by transport patterns between fluvial runoff
   and northwesterly winds plus ocean currents. Some pollen changes and
   limits of pollen zones coincided with the timing of Heinrich events,
   implying that the rapid climate fluctuations during MIS 3 and MIS 2 may
   have partially resulted in the forest changes in Eastern Asia. The
   pattern of relative abundance of subtropical and total arboreal taxa is
   consistent with that of delta(18)O from Hulu Cave, implying monsoonal
   climatic control over vegetation change. The estimated temperature (MAT)
   by the means of pollen ratios for the LGM was 5-8 degrees C lower than
   that in the Changjiang River mouth today. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Pollen-based climate reconstructions were performed on two
   high-resolution pollen marines cores from the Alboran and Aegean Seas in
   order to unravel the climatic variability in the coastal settings of the
   Mediterranean region between 15 000 and 4000 years BP (the Lateglacial,
   and early to mid-Holocene). The quantitative climate reconstructions for
   the Alboran and Aegean Sea records focus mainly on the reconstruction of
   the seasonality changes (temperatures and precipitation), a crucial
   parameter in the Mediterranean region. This study is based on a
   multi-method approach comprising 3 methods: the Modern Analogues
   Technique (MAT), the recent Non-Metric Multidimensional
   Scaling/Generalized Additive Model method (NMDS/GAM) and Partial Least
   Squares regression (PLS). The climate signal inferred from this
   comparative approach confirms that cold and dry conditions prevailed in
   the Mediterranean region during the Oldest and Younger Dryas periods,
   while temperate conditions prevailed during the Bolling/Allerod and the
   Holocene. Our records suggest a West/East gradient of decreasing
   precipitation across the Mediterranean region during the cooler
   Late-glacial and early Holocene periods, similar to present-day
   conditions. Winter precipitation was highest during warm intervals and
   lowest during cooling phases. Several short-lived cool intervals (i.e.
   Older Dryas, another oscillation after this one (GI-1c2),
   Gerzensee/Preboreal Oscillations, 8.2 ka event, Bond events) connected
   to the North Atlantic climate system are documented in the Alboran and
   Aegean Sea records indicating that the climate oscillations associated
   with the successive steps of the deglaciation in the North Atlantic area
   occurred in both the western and eastern Mediterranean regions. This
   observation confirms the presence of strong climatic linkages between
   the North Atlantic and Mediterranean regions.}},

Abstract = {{The artificial neural network (ANN) method was applied to dinoflagellate
   cyst (dinocyst) assemblages to estimate palaeoceanographical conditions.
   The ANN method was adapted to three distinct data bases covering the
   northern North Atlantic (N = 371), plus the Arctic seas (N = 540) and
   the Bering Sea (N = 646). The relative abundance of 23 dinocyst taxa was
   calibrated against hydrographic variables (sea-surface temperature,
   salinity and density in February and August, and seasonal extent of
   sea-ice cover) using ANNs. The estimation of hydrographical parameters
   based on an ANN yields high coefficients of correlation between
   observations and reconstructions for each variable selected. The
   validation tests performed on the different data bases suggest more
   accurate calibration at the scale of the North Atlantic and Arctic (N =
   540) than on a multibasin scale, i.e. when including the subpolar North
   Pacific (N = 646). The ANN calibrations and the modern analogue
   technique (MAT) have been applied to two sequences from the northwest
   North Atlantic spanning the past 25 000 yr for the purpose of
   comparison. Both approaches yielded similar results, generally within
   the range of their respective uncertainties, demonstrating their
   suitability. The main discrepancies generally correspond to assemblages
   with poor modern analogues for which we have to admit a higher degree of
   uncertainties in the reconstruction, whatever the approach used.

Abstract = {{The Salads Mediana lacustrine sequence, central Ebro Basin, Spain (41
   degrees 30'10 ``N, 0 degrees 44'W, 350 m a.s.l.) provides an example of
   the potential and limitations of saline lake records as palaeoclimate
   proxies in the semi-arid Mediterranean region. Sedimentary facies
   analyses, chemical stratigraphy, stable isotopes (delta (18)O and delta
   (13)C) of authigenic carbonates, delta (13)C values of bulk organic
   matter and pollen analyses from sediment cores provide paleohydrological
   and vegetation change reconstructions for the Lateglacial and Late
   Holocene in the central Ebro basin. A preliminary chronology is based on
   (210)Pb and (14)C AMS dates. The lacustrine sequence is composed of
   three sedimentary Sections. The Lower Section was deposited in a
   permanent saline to brackish lake. This stage represents the most humid
   period in the record and it was accompanied by the expansion of
   temperate trees (particularly Corylus). The Middle Section was deposited
   in an ephemeral playa-lake complex. Frequent subaerial exposure
   conditions favour the colonisation of the playa lake floor by
   Chenopodiaceae during a low water table period. This interval reflects
   the most arid conditions ill the Salads Mediana record, including the
   current environment. A secondary temperate tree expansion occurred after
   the maximum aridity period. Aquatic plants and cyanobacterial mats
   spread in the lake during periods of raised water tables. This
   paleohydrological and vegetational evolution attests to large changes in
   effective moisture during the Lateglacial in the semi-arid northeastern
   Spain. The abundance of Corylus during the Lateglacial indicates that
   refugia for temperate trees were located along the Ebro valley during
   the Last Glacial Maximum. The Holocene sediments in the Salada Mediana
   records have been eroded, and the Upper Section represents deposition
   during the last few centuries. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

Abstract = {{Twenty deep-sea sediment cores from the western Pacific between
   30-degrees-N and 30-degrees-S provide evidence of sea-surface
   temperature (SST) changes throughout the tropics and subtropics. Glacial
   SSTs were estimated using the modem analog technique (MAT) applied to
   planktonic foraminifers and planktonic foraminiferal deltaO-18 changes.
   We used deltaO-18 to identify the last glacial maximum. The MAT method
   differs from the traditional transfer function approach in that it
   utilizes a global coretop database, and estimates paleotemperature by
   finding analogs from the modem coretop samples. In addition, the MAT
   approach appears to be less susceptible than the transfer function
   technique to biases introduced by carbonate dissolution. Our results
   indicate that tropical SSTs differed by less than 2-degrees-C from
   present; away from the tropics (30-degrees-N and 30-degrees-S) SSTs were
   at least 3-degrees-C cooler. Our results differ from those of previous
   studies in the western Pacific by using a set of well-preserved,
   high-sedimentation rate cores from shallow regions. The results of this
   study clearly indicate that a western Pacific warm pool existed during
   the last glacial maximum (LGM), providing a heat and moisture source for
   a Walker Circulation cell similar to that of today. We propose that a
   steeper lapse rate existed during the last glacial maximum and that this
   can explain at least part of the discrepancy between marine and
   terrestrial temperature estimates adjacent to New Guinea for the LGM.

Abstract = {{The CLIMAP {[}1981] reconstruction of the Coral Sea found relatively
   little cooling (2 degrees C) in the low latitudes (10 degrees S) but a
   warming off Australia at about 25 degrees S. The small low-latitude
   changes are of interest because terrestrial pollen and snowline data
   from the New Guinea highlands imply that surface temperatures may have
   been 6 degrees to 9 degrees C colder at the last glacial maximum (LGM).
   The purpose of this paper is to evaluate these conclusions on the basis
   of additional core sites, new oxygen isotope stratigraphy, and new sea
   surface temperature (SST) estimates using the modern analog technique
   (MAT). In the northern Coral Sea, planktonic foraminifer assemblages
   consist of tropical-subtropical species that show little change over the
   past 20 kyr. Quantitative estimates of SST using the modern analog
   technique (MAT) confirm the CLIMAP {[}1981] conclusion that little or no
   temperature change occurred in this tropical region at the LGM, thus
   reinforcing the conflict with terrestrial evidence. In the southern
   region (25 degrees S), two cores indicate that foraminifer faunas became
   more subtropical at the LGM. The MAT estimates for the LGM are 3 degrees
   to 4 degrees C colder than modern, producing a steeper thermal gradient
   in the southern Coral Sea. These data remove the warm SST anomaly along
   the eastern coast of Australia and indicate that during the LGM, cool
   high- latitude waters were displaced northward along the coast of
   Australia into the southern Coral Sea.}},
